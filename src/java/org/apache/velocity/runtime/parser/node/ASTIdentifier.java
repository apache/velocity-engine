/**
 *  ASTIdentifier.java
 *
 *  Method support for identifiers :  $foo
 *
 *  mainly used by ASTRefrence
 *
 *  Introspection is now moved to 'just in time' or at render / execution time.
 *  There are many reasons why this has to be done, but the primary two are 
 *  thread safety, to remove any context-derived information from class member
 *  variables.
 *
 *  Please look at the Parser.jjt file which is
 *  what controls the generation of this class.
