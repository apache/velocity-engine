        Make FileResourceLoader unicode aware to allow skipping over BOM markers
        like those created by Windows Notepad. This is a workaround for a Java
        bug, where Java itself does not recognize the UTF-8 BOM as defined by
        the unicode standard.

      <action type="update" dev="wglass" issue="VELOCITY-196" due-to="">
        Velocity now searches in the current thread's context classloader
        before the system classloader for all templates loaded with the
        ClasspathResourceLoader and for all user-defined ResourceLoaders,
        introspectors, event handlers, etc.
        A typical use for this is to have Velocity in the application
        container classpath while keeping templates and plugins in the
        webapp classpath.
      </action>

      <action type="update" dev="wglass" issue="" due-to="Thomas Veith">
        #set now sets references to null when required.  For backwards

        Revert the split between org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.node.Node and
        org.apache.velocity.runtime.parser.Node. The parser now only uses ...parser.node.Node

            Made a lot of internal logging upgrades including: Deprecated LogSystem interface

            added getLog() to RuntimeServices (and all its friends) to improve on and replace its now deprecated
            logging methods, added a JdkLogChute as a 3rd default option for those using JDK 1.4+, and added a
            StandardOutLogChute as final resort if other LogChute inits fail. See JIRA issues VELOCITY-403, VELOCITY-166,

        </action>

        <action type="remove" dev="dlr" issue="" due-to="">
            Removed the long-deprecated Log4JLogSystem.  Never fear,
            SimpleLog4JLogSystem remains.

        <action type="update" dev="dlr" issue="" due-to="">
            Enhanced the implementation of ResourceCacheImpl using Jakarta Commons
            Collections LRUMap class.  The previous greedy implementation did not
            set an upper bound for the cache size, meaning that cached resources
            were never relinquished (a possible memory leak).  You can continue to
            use that behavior by setting the
            <code>resource.manager.cache.size</code> for your cache to less than
            1.

            put back old version of SimpleLog4JLogSystem, as deprecated.  That way
            we can move forward with an up-to-date version that uses Logger, and
            for one release, be backwards compatile for the Category-using log4j
            crowd.

        <action type="remove" dev="dlr" issue="" due-to="">
            Deprecated the org.apache.velocity.servlet.VelocityServlet class in
            favor of org.apache.velocity.tools.view.servlet.VelocityViewServlet
