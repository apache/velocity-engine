  <title>Building Velocity from Source</title>
  <author email="dev@velocity.apache.org">Velocity Documentation Team</author>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Installation">

<p>
Velocity runs on a variety of platforms that have installed the Java
Virtual Machine. The Java Development Kit version 1.6 is required for users who want to compile
Velocity from its source code.
</p>

<p>
Everything required to build Velocity comes with the distribution, which
can be obtained from <a
href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/velocity/engine/">Subversion</a> or
from the <a
href="http://velocity.apache.org/download.cgi#Engine">main distribution</a>.
However, you will need to install <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> to build the Velocity sources.</p>


<p><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> is also an Apache project.
To build Apache Velocity, you need at least Version 2.2.1 of Apache Maven.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Required Tools">

<p>
To build Velocity we require <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>
version 2.2.1 or higher (Mave 3 can be used too) to perform the build process.
We assume that you have followed Maven's installation instructions and have it properly installed.
</p>

<p>
Velocity requires JDK 1.6 or greater to compile.
</p>

<p>
Finally, if you wish to modify Velocity's grammar you will need to a tool
called <a href="http://javacc.dev.java.net">JavaCC</a>.  We recommend
version 3.2 or greater (for compatibility with JDK 1.5 syntax changes).
</p>

</section>

<section name="Building">

<p>
In each case below, it is assumed that you were successful in getting
the distribution from Subversion, and with the latter,
were successful in unpacking.  Also, it is assumed that you are starting
in the 'velocity' directory, the root of the distribution tree.
All directory references will be relative to 'velocity'.
</p>

<p>
Change to the <b>build</b> directory (<code>cd
build</code>). Then, to build the jar file, simply type:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
mvn install
]]></source>

<p>
Executing this script will create a <b>target</b> directory
within the Velocity distribution directory. Each subdirectory
containing a module of Velocity will contain a "target" directory
too, containing all built jars. In the "velocity-assembly" module
you will find built distributions.
</p>

<p>
Refer to Maven documentation for all phases you can invoke.
</p>

<p>
If you find a problem, do not hesitate to ask the Velocity community
via our mail lists. They can be found <a
href="http://velocity.apache.org/contact.html">here</a>.
