# This is a simple example of a velocity properties file.
#
# Any property that is not listed here will have it's default
# value used.  The default values are located in :
#  *  src/java/org/apache/velocity/runtime/default/velocity.defaults
#  *  http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/developer-guide.html
#
# as an example, we are changing the name of the velocity log 
#
runtime.log = velocity_example.log
