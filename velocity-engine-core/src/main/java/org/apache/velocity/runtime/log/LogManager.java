/**
 * <p>
 * This class is responsible for instantiating the correct LogChute
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The approach is :
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      First try to see if the user is passing in a living object
 *      that is a LogChute, allowing the app to give its living
 *      custom loggers.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *       Next, run through the (possible) list of classes specified
 *       specified as loggers, taking the first one that appears to
 *       work.  This is how we support finding logkit, log4j or
 *       jdk logging, whichever is in the classpath and found first,
 *       as all three are listed as defaults.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      Finally, we turn to the System.err stream and print log messages
 *      to it if nothing else works.
 *  </li>
