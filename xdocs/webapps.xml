<section name="Building a Web Application with Velocity" href="BuildingaWebApplicationwithVelocity">

<p>
Velocity is often used to generate web pages in applications, usually as a direct replacement
for JSP.  Some of the benefits of using Velocity to generate web pages are:
</p>
      
<ul>
<li> <strong>Simplicity</strong> - The pages can be written and maintained by non-technical web designers.
</li>

<li> <strong>Ease of maintainance</strong> - Scripting is removed from web pages with the recommended MVC approach.
</li>

<li> <strong>Access both methods and properties</strong> - Web designers can reference methods as well as properties of objects in a context.
</li>

<li> <strong>Consistency</strong> - Velocity can be used for other text generation tasks (such as sending email) 
providing a consistent way to mark up text.
</li>
</ul>

<p>This document provides some basic info on getting started with Velocity in a web application.
</p>

</section>

<section name="Use a Framework" href="UseaFramework">

<p>
The primary purpose of the core Velocity engine is simply to generate text based on 
a template.  Consequently, Velocity does not contain any web-related functionality in and of itself.  
To make a web application, you will need a framework to respond to HTTP requests, 
handle user authentication, make business logic calls, and generate a response.  
There are several strong contenders.
</p>

<ol>
<li>  <strong>Velocity Tools / VelocityViewServlet</strong> -
The easiest way to get started is to download the companion <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/">Velocity Tools</a> 
subproject and use the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/view/">VelocityViewServlet</a>.  This servlet is easy to configure 
and install.  You create a directory of templates on your web server, edit an XML file that lists various "Tools" to 
place in the context and you are off.  More details can be found in the tutorial below.
</li>

<li>  <strong>Velocity Tools / VelocityStruts</strong> -
You may be familiar with the popular <a href="http://struts.apache.org/">Struts</a> framework, originally designed to provide much needed
application functionality to JSP.  With the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/struts/">VelocityStruts</a>
module of Velocity Tools you can substitute Velocity for JSP as the page template language.  This allows you 
to take advantage of the large base of Struts infrastructure while designing pages using Velocity.
</li>

<li><strong>Third party frameworks</strong> - There are a number of third party frameworks listed on the 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/PoweredByVelocity">PoweredByVelocity</a>
wiki page.  Of these, <a href="http://www.springframework.org/">Spring</a> is probably the most sophisticated and well known.
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/turbine/">Jakarta Turbine</a> has many features and can also be very useful.  
It was built with Velocity as the primary page language, which is not surprising since many of the original Velocity
developers were involved in creating it.
A simpler alternative is the <a href="http://mav.sourceforge.net/">Maverick</a> framework
which provides a simple Controller architecture that integrates nicely with
Velocity but has no bells or whistles.
</li>

<li><strong>Build your own</strong> - A final alternative is to build your own framework.  Create a dispatcher servlet,
retrieve templates from a file or database, integate with your business logic and send the results back to the user.
Often you'll have an easier time starting with one of the existing frameworks
and customizing it.  In particular you can add new functionality to the VelocityViewServlet simply by creating a subclass.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
As a side note, you may also come across references to VelocityServlet, which is a deprecated servlet that was included in
the Velocity Core up to version 1.4.  Since VelocityServlet is no longer being maintained we strongly recommend
you use VelocityViewServlet in Velocity Tools instead.
</p>

<section name="Web-Specific Issues" href="Web-SpecificIssues">
<p>
There are a few issues with Velocity that are specific to web applications.  Here is a brief discussion of the most 
commonly encountered issues.
</p>

<subsection name="Changing Object State - Don't!" href="ChangingObjectState-Don't!">
<p>Velocity provides the ability to call any method of an object acting as a reference.  This can be useful when displaying 
information into the page but is dangerous when object or application state is modified.
</p>

<p>
For example,
the following code safely calls the size() method of a list and displays the result.
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
There are $users.size() currently logged in.
]]></source>

<p>
An example of an unsafe operation concerns a financial web page with an object in the context that calculates
data year by year.  The method calculateNextYear() calculates data for the next year and advances an internal counter:
</p>

<source><![CDATA[
2005 data: $table.data
$table.calculateNextYear()
2006 data: $table.data
]]></source>

<p>The problem with this approach is that the code cannot be repeated in multiple parts of the page.  You may not intend
to do so, but it's easy to forget this when cutting and pasting or writing control statements (such as #if or #foreach).
This becomes more of an issue when you are dealing with application or session-level state.  
</p>

<p>The (strongly) recommended practice is
to only use Velocity for inserting information into text.  Method calls can be useful to retrieve information.  However, it's generally a bad idea
to use a method call to change object state, and it's always a bad idea to change application state.  
</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing to change object state (as in the previous example) try precalculating all the possible
values in the controller and putting them in a List or Map.  Any changes to application state should always be
done by the controller.
</p>

<p>On a related note, you should always put a List or Set into the context instead of an Iterator or Enumeration.  This allows the collection to 
be used more than once in the page with no change in behavior.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Escaping HTML/XML Entities" href="EscapingHTML/XMLEntities">

<p>
Any user-entered text that contains special HTML or XML entities (such as &lt;, &gt;, or &amp;) needs to be escaped 
before included in the web page.  This is required, both to ensure the text is visible, and also to prevent
dangerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_site_scripting">cross-site scripting</a>.  
Unlike, for example, JSTL (the Java Standard Tag Language found in Java Server Pages), 
Velocity does not contain any HTML-specific escaping functionality.  However, you have three options:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a special "Tool" (an object in the context) with a method that performs escaping, for example
$escape.html($usertext).  This is conceptually the easiest way to solve this problem.
</li>
<li>Create a custom <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/HackingVelocity">ReferenceInsertionEventHandler</a> that automatically escapes every reference.
If all references need to be escaped, this is the most painless method.
</li>
<li>Create a <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/HackingVelocity">custom directive</a> (e.g. #escape) that escapes all text within the directive block.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that other kinds of escaping are sometimes required.  For example, in style sheets the @ character needs
to be escaped, and in Javascript strings the single apostrophe ' needs to be escaped.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Securing the Application" href="SecuringtheApplication">

<p>
Since a web application is running on a central server, that typically has multiple users and confidential resources, 
care must be taken to make certain that the web application is secure.  Most standard web security principles apply to a 
web application built with Velocity.  A few specific issues (such as system configuration, more on cross-site scripting, 
and method introspection) are written up in this article on 
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/BuildingSecureWebApplications">Building Secure Applications with Velocity</a>.
</p>

</subsection>

<subsection name="Log Files" href="LogFiles">

<p>
A minor point is that Velocity, in the absence of any log-related configuration, creates a log file in the current directory.  
When Velocity is used in a web application the "current directory" is usually the current directory from which the application
server is started.  If you start seeing the file "velocity.log" files in random places on your server filesystem, check
the Velocity log configuration.  Typically this occurs when Velocity is used within a web application outside of web page
generation (e.g. for sending email).
</p>

<section name="Tutorial" href="Tutorial">

<p>
What follows is a brief tutorial on building a simple web app with VelocityViewServlet.  For more information, consult the 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/">Velocity Tools</a> documentation.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the Velocity Tools project source (you need the source for the examples)
from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/downloads/">Jakarta download page</a>.  
</li>

<li>If you haven't already installed <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a>. do so now.
</li>

<li> Build the Velocity Tools jar and the "simple" example by typing:
<source><![CDATA[
ant example.simple
]]></source>
</li>

<li>Take a look at the "examples" directory.  You will see a file "index.vm".  Here's an excerpt:

<source><![CDATA[
<html>
<body>
I'm a velocity template.

#if( $XHTML )
  #set( $br = "<br />" )
#else
  #set( $br = "<br>" )
#end

$br
$br

Here we use a custom tool: $toytool.message

$br
$br

Here we get the date from the DateTool:  $date.medium
</body>
</html>
]]></source>


You can copy any additional velocity files
into this same directory.  In examples/WEB-INF you will see a file "toolbox.xml".  This specifies a list of "Tools" 
that are automatically included in the context.  

<source><![CDATA[
<toolbox>
  <xhtml>true</xhtml>
  <tool>
     <key>toytool</key>
     <class>ToyTool</class>
  </tool>
  <data type="number">
    <key>version</key>
    <value>1.1</value>
  </data>
  <data type="boolean">
    <key>isSimple</key>
    <value>true</value>
  </data>
  <data type="string">
    <key>foo</key>
    <value>this is foo.</value>
  </data>
  <data type="string">
    <key>bar</key>
    <value>this is bar.</value>
  </data>
  <tool>
    <key>map</key>
    <class>java.util.HashMap</class>
  </tool>
  <tool>
    <key>date</key>
    <scope>application</scope>
    <class>org.apache.velocity.tools.generic.DateTool</class>
  </tool>
</toolbox>
]]></source>

And finally the web.xml file specifies the name of the servlet and location of toolbox.properties.
<source><![CDATA[
<web-app>
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>velocity</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
        org.apache.velocity.tools.view.servlet.VelocityViewServlet
    </servlet-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>org.apache.velocity.toolbox</param-name>
      <param-value>/WEB-INF/toolbox.xml</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <load-on-startup>10</load-on-startup>
  </servlet>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>velocity</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>*.vm</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
  <welcome-file-list>
    <welcome-file>index.vm</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>
</web-app>
]]></source>

</li>
<li>Copy this directory into your "webapps" directory on Tomcat.  You could also copy "simple.war", but copying in the entire directory
will let you experiment with changes.  You should now be able to access your simple one-page webapp with this URL.  (or something similar):

<source><![CDATA[
http://localhost:8080/simple/index.vm
]]></source>

</li>
<li>Experiment with adding new Velocity pages.  Note that you can access any velocity page just by changing the URL.  Try changing the
entries in toolbox.xml or creating your own tools.  Consult the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity/tools/">Velocity Tools</a> 
documentation and the <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-velocity/">Wiki</a> for more info on the wide variety of tools available.
</li>
</ol>
