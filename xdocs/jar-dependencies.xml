       Velocity has a number of external jar dependencies. However, not all of these
       are needed every time.This document should help you do decide which jars must
       also be present if you want to integrate Velocity into your application.
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>jar name</th><th>Required</th><th>Explanation</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>commons-collections</td><td>Yes</td>
          <td>Needed for all parts of Velocity</td>

          <td>Only needed when the VelocityServlet class is used. Should
              normally be supplied by the servlet container. <b>VelocityServlet
              is deprecated and should be replaced with VelocityViewServlet from
              the velocity-tools distribution.</b></td>

      <p>
        The most common case is the integration of the Velocity runtime into your
        application. In this case, you must also add commons-collections, commons-lang
        and oro to your application (and either avalon-logkit or log4j for logging if
        required). If you already have one or more of these libraries in your application,
        you should check if you need to update their versions.
